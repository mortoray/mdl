Based on the few I sampled, the WHO guide is based on studies that don’t do adequate audience targeting, rely on faulty self-reporting, and fail to consider numerous factors that affect the results. This conclusion is supported by meta-studies^meta done in this decade. 

@Aside
In fairness, the WHO is heavily influenced by politics, lobbying, and cultural norms. It’d be impossible for them to publish that differs too much from current trends. Though I’m concerned by a followup report.
	
	We can't ignore the types of diets that WHO is analyzing as well.

Discarding the heart-diet claim doesn’t mean you have to jump into a low-carb diet plan. There are positive effects of any reduced carbohydrates and increased fat^lancet. You gain these benefits without going into the very low carbohydrate territory.
