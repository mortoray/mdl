It's been a while since my last update as I've not had a lot of time to work on the parser.  So is the life of side-projects. :/

This time around I've made changes to support lists. In the spirit of the feature the changes are:

- List parsing syntax, those are lines that begin with `-`
- Adding a `_NodeIterator` to `parse_to_doc.py` to deal with nested iterating
- Probably adding backtick support, just to write `\`_NodeIterator\`` above
