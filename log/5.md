It's been a while since my last update as I've not had a lot of time to work on the parser.  So is the life of side-projects. :/

This time around I've made changes to support lists. In the spirit of the feature the changes are:

- List parsing syntax, those are lines that begin with `-`
- Adding a `_NodeIterator` to `parse_to_doc.py` to deal with nested iterating
- Adding backtick support, because I needed to write `\`_NodeIterator\`` above


## Lists

Unlike in [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), the MDL lists can be separated over multiple lines. This makes it easier to work with longer sentences and markup inside those bullet points.

- You can't see this.

- But there was an extra space between these points.

Markdown supports indented lists, which might be easier to read in the source. This isn't a concern for me now, and I'll leave out support for them. I'll also ignore embedded lists until I have a decent use-case for it.


## Splitting anchor parsing

I've made a change to how the parsing handles anchors. I'm deviating a bit from what [HTML says an anchor is](https://www.w3.org/html/). In MDL an anchor is only a piece of text that could have something associated with it -- almost what `<a>` used to mean in HTML prior to version 5, the version which made it exclusive for linking.

The parse change is that `[anchor blocks]` are parsed independently of any trailing bits now, such as a full link `[anchor](link)`.  This new parsing is easier and more flexible. The conversion into a link is done by the tree conversion. It has a better ability to detect flow like this.

An `[anchor bit]` without a trailing link raises an error now. Eventually, for a markdown compatible mode, that might need to be reverted to plain text.

This change, along with the backtick support, allowed me to switch to an unparsed segment for the URL.


## Backtick support

Given how much I'm using a backtick `\`` in this document, it's surprising I didn't add support for it earlier.

Unlike markdown, escaping in MDL is done with the backslash `\\` character. It's one of the characters that is recognized even inside escaped sections, like the backticks.
