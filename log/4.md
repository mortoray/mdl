# Parsing footnotes and code blocks (MDL Log #4)

In this update I've added footnote parsing and basic rendering^intro.  This is motivated by Mogo's user story, where he needs to add source information to his articles. This is something I need when I write health related articles. Footnotes provide an alternative to linking words -- they are more natural in many contexts when citing sources.

^intro See, it's not a lie. There was indeed a footnote reference from the introduction to here.

## Mogo's User Portrait

_Mogo is a freelance medical journalist. Free travels to various countries, primarily Africa, and publishes health articles in a prestigious online journal. She conducts local interviews to get a personal feeling to events, and to discover what is important to these communities. She supplements her interviews with searchs in science publications for source information_

_The journal has farily rigid requirements for publishing articles. Prior to writing they request outlines and will provde feedback on them. They have a Word template to submit the outlines. Mogo, as most writers, starts recording her ideas and interview notes, prior to completing the outline. She then manually transfers the key sections into the headline template. When feedback is returned she then manually updates her source notes._

_The journal requires extensive sourcing information, both references for interviews and source links for research. This must be done as endnotes in Word, with numeric links in the text. Mogo spends a lot of time cleaning up this information as she forgets to update links or notes. Occassionally she deletes a source with the text as well. It's a tedious part of her work._

This lets us derive two relevant user stories, the first, in short-form is "A user, will export an outline, to satisfy publication pre-planning". It sounds okay. 

But the next feature, is about using the various footnote features of MDL, and having them formatted to the target format. This is somewhat awkward to record in a standard user story short-form. Saying, "A user, will use various inline, external, and end notes, because they want to have unified footnotes" is somewhat wordy and confusing. It's why I'm not in favour of strict user story forms. We can instead say, "Mogo wants convenient MDL notes that export to her publication's desired format."

As with last time, I'm going to focus on the low-level MDL features here. The project is not interested in the UI layer yet, which this user would most likely desire. Though possibly not, a lot of content writers don't care what tool they use, and a text editor that fulfills their other needs might be acceptible to some.
