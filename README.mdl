# MDL - Mortoray's Document Language

My markdown language for documents: blogs, ebooks, and print.

I use this tool on a day-to-day basis for my own work. It is however probably not yet stable enough for your use. If you would like to use it, then ping me, and I can look towards making the high-level interface a bit more stable.

## Running

There is an entry point defined on the module that that reads MDL files and emits either HTML or Markdown.

```
python -m mdl --help
```

Example:

```
python -m mdl README.mdl --write-markdown README.md
```

Be aware that not all emitters will support all of the doc-tree at any given time. It's all in flux now.


## Python 3.8

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3.8
sudo apt install python3.8-distutils python3.8-dev


sudo apt-get install python3.8-venv
```
