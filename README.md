# MDL - Mortoray's Document Language

My markdown language for documents: blogs, ebooks, and print.

This project is in its infancy at the moment, being more of a proof-of-concept at this stage.

Follow the development over on [dev.to](https://dev.to/mortoray)


## Running

There is no driver program at the moment. Only the test program.

```
python3 log/2.md
```

This dumps the parse tree, the doc tree, and whatever else I felt I needed at that time I last committed.

A proper command-line tool might be useful for teaching... I'll work on that.
