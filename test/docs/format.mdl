# First Part

```
Some code.
```

We made need a [link](somewhere).

```py
def python_code():

```

# Listy Part

Don't forget the headers.

- List Item :: Text description.
- Second item :: Okay.

Nor the notes^2.

^2 [Line note](http://special.com/)

- You can also have
- A list
	- inside the _previous list_
	- it's *important* to format
- Don't also get back up.
